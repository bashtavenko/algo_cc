## Stable

Original array: `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]`
After stable sort: `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]`
In this case, the two 1's maintain their original relative order.

Original list:

```
[("Alice", 85), ("Bob", 90), ("Charlie", 85), ("David", 80)]
```

sorting with stable sort:

```
[("Bob", 90), ("Alice", 85), ("Charlie", 85), ("David", 80)]
```

Alice and Charlie both have 85, but Alice remains before Charlie because that was their original order.
