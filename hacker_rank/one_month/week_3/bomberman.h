// Bomberman lives in a rectangular grid. Each cell in the grid either contains
// a bomb or nothing at all.
//
// Each bomb can be planted in any cell of the grid but once planted, it will
// detonate after exactly 3 seconds. Once a bomb detonates, it's destroyed â€”
// along with anything in its four neighboring cells. This means that if a bomb
// detonates in cell i, j, any valid cells (i +- 1, j) and (i, j+-1)  are
// cleared. If there is a bomb in a neighboring cell, the neighboring bomb is
// destroyed without detonating, so there's no chain reaction.
//
// Bomberman is immune to bombs, so he can move freely throughout the grid.
// Here's what he does:
//
// 1. Initially, Bomberman arbitrarily plants bombs in some of the cells, the
// initial state.
// 2. After one second, Bomberman does nothing.
// 3. After one more second, Bomberman plants bombs in all cells without bombs,
// thus filling the whole grid with bombs. No bombs detonate at this point.
// 4. After one more
// second, any bombs planted exactly three seconds ago will detonate. Here,
// Bomberman stands back and observes.
// 5. Bomberman then repeats steps 3 and 4
// indefinitely. Note that during every second Bomberman plants bombs, the bombs
// are planted simultaneously (i.e., at the exact same moment), and any bombs
// planted at the same time will detonate at the same time.
//
// Given the initial configuration of the grid with the locations of Bomberman's
// first batch of planted bombs, determine the state of the grid after  seconds.
//
// Initial state
// .......
// ...O...
// ....O..
// .......
// OO.....
// OO.....
//
// Result
// OOO.OOO
// OO...OO
// OOO...O
// ..OO.OO
// ...OOOO
// ...OOOO
